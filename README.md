## Business Problem Statement :
  Thyroid disease is a common cause of medical diagnosis and prediction, with an onset that is difficult to forecast in medical research. The thyroid gland is one of our body's most vital organs. Thyroid hormone releases are responsible for metabolic regulation. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are one of the two common diseases of the thyroid that releases thyroid hormones in regulating the rate of body's metabolism.The main goal is to predict the estimated risk on a patient's chance of obtaining thyroid  disease or not.
## Abstract :
Thyroid gland plays a major role in maintaining the metabolism of human body. Data mining in health care industry provides a systematic use of the medical data. Thyroid diseases are most common today. Early changes in the thyroid gland will not affect the proper working of the gland. By the early identification of thyroid disorders, better treatment can be provided in the early stage thus can avoid thyroid replacement therapy and thyroid removal up to an extent.
### Dataset Link :  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/thyroid+disease
### Data :
  1:	Class attribute (1 = normal, 2 = hyper, 3 = hypo)
	2:	T3-resin uptake test. (A percentage)
	3:	Total Serum thyroxin as measured by the isotopic
		displacement method. 
	4: 	Total serum triiodothyronine as measured by radioimmuno
		assay.
	5: 	basal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as measured by 
  ### Conflicts Of intrest :
      
●	PyCharm is used as IDE.
●	For visualization of the plots, Matplotlib, Seaborn are used.
●	Azure is used for deployment of the model.
●	Cassandra is used to retrieve, insert, delete, and update the database.
●	Front end development is done using Streamlit , Flask is used for backend development and for API development.
●	GitHub is used as version control system
### Conclusion :
This Project proposes a method for the classification and diagnosis of thyroid disease that a user is suffering from along with disease description and healthy advices. Support Vector Machine is used for classification.
